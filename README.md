# Documentary-of-Bug-Bounty-Reports
This repository contains a collection of security vulnerability reports discovered through my participation in various bug bounty programs for an assignment in a module of my degree program. Each report includes a detailed explanation of the issue, steps to reproduce, proof of concept (PoC), impact analysis, and recommended remediations. 


The purpose of this repository is to:
Showcase my skills in web application security and vulnerability research
Share real-world examples of security issues for educational purposes
Contribute to the ethical hacking and infosec community

 Use Case:
Educational: Learn how real bugs are found and reported.
Portfolio: Demonstrate technical skills to employers or bug bounty platforms.
Collaborative: Open to contributions, feedback, or report format improvements.

Disclaimer: All findings presented here were reported through authorized bug bounty programs or coordinated disclosure, and no illegal activity was involved.
